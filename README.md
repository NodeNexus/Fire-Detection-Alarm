# ESP32 Multi-Sensor Fire Detection & Alarm System

## üöÄ Features

* **Flame Detection:** Uses an **LM393** IR sensor for instant, direct flame detection.
* **Smoke & Gas Detection:** Monitors for combustible gases and smoke using an **MQ-2** sensor.
* **Temperature Monitoring:** A **DHT22** sensor tracks ambient temperature, acting as a secondary check for high-heat conditions.
* **Visual Display:** A 0.96" **SSD1306** OLED screen shows real-time sensor data and system status ("SYSTEM NORMAL" / "FIRE ALERT").
* **Audible & Visual Alarm:** A bright **Red LED** and a loud **Buzzer** immediately activate when a fire condition is detected.
* **Dual-Trigger Logic:** The alarm triggers if **either** a flame is seen (digital trigger) **or** smoke levels exceed a calibrated threshold (analog trigger).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Software & Setup

1.  **Install Arduino IDE:** Make sure you have the latest [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) installed.
2.  **Add ESP32 Board Manager:**
    * Go to **File > Preferences**.
    * In "Additional Board Manager URLs", add:
        ```
        [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json)
        ```
    * Go to **Tools > Board > Boards Manager...**, search for "esp32", and install it.
3.  **Install Libraries:**
    * Go to **Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...**.
    * Search for and install the following libraries:
        * `Adafruit SSD1306`
        * `Adafruit GFX Library`
        * `DHT sensor library` (by Adafruit)
        * `Adafruit Unified Sensor` (will be installed as a dependency)

## üî• Usage & Calibration

### **Important: Calibrating the Smoke Sensor**

The `SMOKE_THRESHOLD` value in the code **must** be calibrated for your specific sensor and environment to prevent false alarms.

1.  Upload the code and open the Arduino Serial Monitor at **115200 baud**.
2.  Let the MQ-2 sensor warm up for 1-2 minutes. You will see the "Smoke Level" value in the Serial Monitor.
3.  Note the stable "Smoke Level" value in clean air (e.g., `450`).
4.  Safely introduce a small amount of smoke (e.g., from a blown-out match) near the sensor. Note the new, higher value (e.g., `1500`).
5.  In the code, set your `SMOKE_THRESHOLD` to a value between these two (e.g., `1000`).

### System Status

* **SYSTEM NORMAL:** The OLED will display "SYSTEM NORMAL" and show the live Temperature, Humidity, and Smoke Level readings. The LED and Buzzer will be OFF.
* **FIRE ALERT:** If a flame is detected (from the LM393) OR the smoke level (from the MQ-2) goes above your `SMOKE_THRESHOLD`, the system will enter an alert state:
    * The OLED screen will flash "FIRE ALERT!".
    * The Red LED will turn ON.
    * The Buzzer will turn ON.
